## About the event

AI Whisperers is diving deep into hardware for 2026. This is the first session of our robotics cohort - a peer exploration group building toward a year-long series focused on ESP32s, sensors, and whatever we want to create together.

### What We're Doing:

- **Hands-on with ESP32 microcontrollers** (6 available)
- **Sensor exploration and experimentation**
- **Chemistry sensing as our anchor project** (led by Juan's expertise)
- **Foundation for autonomous robots**, mesh networking, voice assistant integration, and beyond

### The Format
This isn't traditional teaching - it's collaborative discovery. Stewart has ESP32s running Meshtastic networks, Raspberry Pi systems, and voice assistants. Juan brings chemistry expertise. You bring your curiosity. We'll figure out what these systems unlock together.

### Who Should Come
Anyone ready to commit to exploring hardware through 2026. Max 6 people in person - intimate cohort building for the long term.

### Bring
Laptop if you want to code along, questions about what you want to build.
